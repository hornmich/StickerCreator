= Sticker creator =

This application is a utility for automated creation of stickers from e-shop orders.

The utility is designed to work with eshop rychle platform for creating quickly eshops.

The expected data feed is a Heureka XML feed file and eshop-rychle orders XML export file.

In principle, the utility downloads the whole portfolio and its metadata (name, images,...), it downloads the exported orders and them maps the orders to the portfolio data. Mapped items are put in a HTML page, cotaining table of stickers. At last, to prevent any missinterpretation, the whole page is converted into an image and cropped to fit a A4 page to be printed.
